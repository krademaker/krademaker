🙋🏻‍♂️ Hello, I am Koen Rademaker, MSc student bioinformatics at VU Amsterdam. Since April 2023 I am in the group of Oliver Stegle (German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg) to conduct my master research thesis, joint with the Omer Bayraktar group (Wellcome Sanger Institute).

🧠 My interests lie in computational biology, genetics and cell biology.

👨🏻‍💻 I mostly work in Python and R, along with Bash / command-line scripting in HPC environments. I have also been trained in Java and SQL during my BSc, but that has been a while already. Learning Julia is still on my to-do list, but more urgent matters (i.e. fixing package versions in Conda) keep getting in the way.

🌱 I am currently diving deeper into machine learning algorithms as I see many opportunities for research questions in bioinformatics. Learning more about Bayesian statistics and Pythonic implementations is also something I am actively pursuing.
